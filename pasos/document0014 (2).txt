Original: 
 Disappointingly, Cameron declined to answer: “Don’t be absurd, madam. Boris was in D block while I was still in F block. And Osborne only went to St Paul’s, which is why his Bullingdon nickname was “Oik ”. Instead, the PM claimed: “It’s good to have lively questions!”, like someone who hasn’t just spent the past five-and -a-half weeks avoiding voters in cowsheds and on sterilised factory floors.
