Original: 
 The problems are obvious. First, he has to overcome the long political shadow of his years as the very public right-hand man of Gordon Brown – to whom he paid the most explicit tribute I've heard this week – and second, his position on the deficit. This is beginning to sound more nuanced than it did during the leadership campaign, and he did not directly contradict the Darling position in his speech, nor when pressed on the BBC's World at One immediately afterwards.
