Original: 
 Why? Many things, including the Iraq legacy. But the surviving Blair/Brown lieutenants who stood against Corbyn in 2015 were not up to the task. They lacked either their own authority or his authenticity as Britain’s Bernie Sanders (whose brother, Larry, lives here by the way, and got 4.5% as a Green candidate on 7 May).
