 “We have a piece of paper in our hand,” Nigel started, waving the Ukip manifesto. It wasn’t quite Neville Chamberlain but perhaps that was just as well. “We are the party who wants our country back,” he continued. “We aren’t against immigrants. We are just against the wrong kind of immigrants. We don’t want foreign criminals. And we don’t want to benefit scroungers. No one should be able to claim benefits unless they have paid their taxes for five years and have no criminal convictions.”
