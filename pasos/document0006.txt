Original: 
 Clegg, too, had pleaded for an apology (though we can assume the chances of any Rennard act of contrition being released as a charity single, like Clegg's 2012 mea culpa over tuition fees, are slim). Why didn't he just suspend him, asked Webb. That was where the Lib Dems' enviably straightforward party management structure came in. "There is not a button that I can push," said Clegg, earnestly wishing there was.
