 Yet huge unanswered issues still remain. We still do not know precisely who paid Mr Werritty, when, and for what gain. We do not know the true role of organisations including the Sri Lanka Development Fund. It is essential that, after the cabinet secretary completes his report on Fox/Werritty, the government refers the wider issues to the independent adviser on ministers' interests. He should look at the issues in their entirety to establish precisely how this never happens again.
