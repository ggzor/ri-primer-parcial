Original: 
 Sir Menzies “Ming” Campbell, Kennedy’s successor who is soon to be Lord Menzies, hobbled into Bournemouth with his new right hip. The former Olympic sprinter is not in training for Rio because he is waiting for a new left hip to go with it. His fiercely devoted wife, Elsbeth, was not in attendance. She won’t attend events that ban smoking, Ming told colleagues.
