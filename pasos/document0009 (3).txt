Original: 
 The day the prime minister makes his junior appointments is a stressful time for the the police on duty at the Downing Street gates. They don’t want to appear rude, but they haven’t a clue who most of the new faces are. All they have to go on is a series of blurred mug shots that were hastily printed out for them a few minutes earlier.
