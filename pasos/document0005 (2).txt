Original: 
 There is a temptation for Labour to be inward looking in opposition, resorting to tribalism and indifference to opinion formers from outside the party. The challenge for the Labour party is not only to be an effective opposition, but a plural one that harnesses all of the progressive critiques of government policy, including those from within the coalition parties.
