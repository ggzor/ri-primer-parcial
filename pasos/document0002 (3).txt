Original: 
 Blair, who puzzled Callaghan, did consult him a bit in old age but did not take much notice, I suspect. It would have been foolish and wrong to sack Brown whose reputation as chancellor stood high before the flighty bankers let down him and everyone else. But he should have protected colleagues better from Brown’s enmity and Damian McBride’s subversion.
