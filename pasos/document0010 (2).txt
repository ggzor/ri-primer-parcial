 But even this appeal to ancient hatreds – “They’re coming, they’re coming and their faces are blue” – seems not to have excited the electorate much. Calm still reigns, calm and a strange willingness in the electorate to leave to politicians and constitutional lawyers the task of solving the problems of 8 May.
