Original: 
 There are current Liberal Democrat MPs that have pioneered social democratic solutions to problems of social exclusion and injustice. Simon Hughes has made countless interventions on issues of housing and youth violence. On Sunday, I listened to Richard Grayson , the former Liberal Democrat director of policy, make an eloquent case for a more active state. Yet these voices are being drowned out by a leadership team that seems to sing from an entirely different hymn sheet.
