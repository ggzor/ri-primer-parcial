Original: 
 But to this visitor’s eye, these mute demonstrators seem to catch the mood of the 2015 campaign. I’m not talking about Scotland. Pride and enthusiasm are on the march up there. But politics isn’t swamping newspapers and television down south. It’s so quiet, so tidy. Much of the time, an election seems hardly to be happening at all.
