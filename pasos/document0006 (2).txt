 Meanwhile, you certainly get an idiosyncratic stripe of small talk in the selfie queue at a Boris gig. “Did you read today that France have closed the refugee camps?” was one chap’s gambit to me. “So I wonder what’s going to happen now?” he went on with an arched eyebrow, like we both totally knew. “Isn’t he an absolute legend?” a young man observed. “Isn’t your day just going to go downhill after this?”
