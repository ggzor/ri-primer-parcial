Original: 
 I have argued throughout that the ministerial code had been broken. Governments must have rules and ministers must have standards: Liam Fox fell foul of the standards and he broke the rules. It now appears clear that while Dr Fox treated Mr Werritty as a friend, Mr Werritty treated Dr Fox as a franchise to bolster his income.
