Original: 
 Much was made of his precocious talent when first elected a Social Democratic party MP at just 23 (“He was a tonic to the group”, ex-MP Ian Wrigglesworth told delegates) and of his opposition to the Iraq war 20 years later. Once he made up his mind, Kennedy was steadfast, but before doing so he privately dithered about that fateful decision.
